PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- On one side there are a lot of people in different EU countries who want to help, who can organize things, who can transfer things to Ukrainian border and beyond it. On the other side, there are ukrainian people who need help in various forms (housing, transportation, food, clothes, money, etc.) who already crossed the broder with EU and the ones who are still fighting in Ukraine. Currently coordination to connect both side, as well as somehow manage needs, quantities, who is covering what happens in the endless Facebook/Instagram discussions that is not efficient. Individual activists across EU do not have a good software tailored to solve current urgent needs.

IDEA:
Impement a web platform that
- connects people who want to donate any type of goods (clothes, towels, dishes, electronics, food, stationery, etc.) with self-organized activits who collect goods and coordinate logistics to either distribute it locally or move things to Ukrainian border or Ukraine directly
- connects people who want to offer services like transportation, help in warehouses etc. as per the needs of self-organized activits
- connects EU people (as well as self-organized activits) with ukrainian refugees to capture their current needs and provide immedaite help
- connects self-organized activits in Ukraine who help army and civil people with self-organized EU activits to better capture their needs and fulfill them
