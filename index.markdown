Hello all, I am looking for IT specialists who can volunteer to work with me minimum 2-3 hours a day in order to develop centralized P2P “Help For Ukraine” platfrom. Working time is flexible but it should be feasible to have a daily 30 minutes call at 9:30 CET time.

There are a lot of people in different EU countries who want to help, who can organize things, who can transfer things to Ukraine and people who need help in various forms (housing, transportation, food, clothes, etc.). Currently this happens in the endless Facebook/Instagram discussions but this is not organized. Individual activists across EU do not have a good software tailored to solve current urgent needs.

Focus of the platfrom will be to connect different people to support:
- EU to Ukriane goods movement
- support need of ukrainian refugees in EU

Currently I am looking for:
- 4 Senior Fullstack Engineers
- 1 Senior DevOps
- 1 Senior UI/UX specialist
- 2 QA people

I would like to start working on this idea tomorrow.

Please DM me if you are ready to participate.

If you can't participate but like the idea - PLEASE REPOST!
