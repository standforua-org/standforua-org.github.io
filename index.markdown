PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- On one side there are a lot of people in different countries who want to help, who can organize the collection of humanitarian help, who can transfer things to the Ukrainian border and beyond it. On the other side, there are Ukrainian people who need help in various forms (housing, transportation, food, clothes, money, etc.) who already crossed the border with the EU and the ones who are still fighting in Ukraine. Currently, coordination to connect both sides, as well as somehow manage needs, quantities, who is covering what happens in the endless Facebook/WhatsApp/Telegram discussions that are not efficient. People do not have good software tailored to solve current urgent needs.

IDEA:
Implement a web platform that
- connects Ukrainian refugees with caring people who are living close to their current location, so that they can receive immediate help
- connects self-organized volunteers and bigger volunteering organizations with caring people outside of Ukraine, to efficiently collect goods and coordinate logistics to either distribute them locally or move things to the Ukrainian border or Ukraine directly
- connects self-organized volunteers in Ukraine who help army and civil people with self-organized EU volunteers to better capture their needs and fulfill them
