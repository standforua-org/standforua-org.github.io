PRODUCT OVERVIEW
----------------------
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- On one side there are a lot of people in different EU countries who want to help, who can organize things, who can transfer things to the Ukrainian border and beyond it. On the other side, there are Ukrainian people who need help in various forms (housing, transportation, food, clothes, money, etc.) who already crossed the border with the EU and the ones who are still fighting in Ukraine. Currently, coordination to connect both sides, as well as somehow manage needs, quantities, who is covering what happens in the endless Facebook/Instagram discussions that are not efficient. Individual activists across the EU do not have good software tailored to solve current urgent needs.

IDEA:
Implement a web platform that
- connects people who want to donate any type of goods (clothes, towels, dishes, electronics, food, stationery, etc.) with self-organized volunteers who collect goods and coordinate logistics to either distribute them locally or move things to the Ukrainian border or Ukraine directly
- connects people who want to offer services like transportation, help in warehouses, etc. as per the needs of self-organized volunteers
- connects EU people (as well as self-organized volunteers) with Ukrainian refugees to capture their current needs and provide immediate help
- connects self-organized volunteers in Ukraine who help army and civil people with self-organized EU volunteers to better capture their needs and fulfil them
